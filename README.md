#Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem) - Coding Challenge.
This project prompts the user to input the student marks (0-100) where A: 80 and above,
B:60-69 , C:50-59 , D:40-49 , E:below 40. If the user enters a value that is not a number then an error will occur.
Also if the user enters a value that is not on the range of 0-100 an error will also occur.
The program keeps on prompting until the user types 'exit' to exit the program.
The grade is displayed on the console.
--------------Steps for running the code:---------------
*The user must have node.js installed.
*Clone or download the repository to the local machine.
*Open a terminal/cmd
*Go to the project directory.
*Run the code with node.js ...in this case its generategrade.js.





---------------Challenge 2:Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
This project takes the speed of as input.
If the speed limit is below 70 it prints "OK"
If the speed is greater 70 , for every 5km/s the driver gets one demerit point.
If a driver gets more than 12 demerit points then the function assigns a 'license suspended' to the driver.
The function also checks if a valid speed has been entered. If not it insructs the user to input the speed again.




--------------- Challenge 3 : Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
This program calculates an individual's net salary by taking their basic salary and benefits as inputs. 
It computes the PAYE (tax), NHIF (National Hospital Insurance Fund), and NSSF (National Social Security Fund) deductions, based on current Kenyan tax rates and deduction guidelines. 
The program then calculates the gross salary (basic salary + benefits) and the net salary after deductions.

The user is prompted to enter their basic salary and benefits, and the program outputs a detailed breakdown, including the gross salary, the tax, the NHIF and NSSF deductions, and the final net salary. 
This tool helps users understand how their salary is affected by different deductions.
